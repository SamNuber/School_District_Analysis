# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
The goal of the project was to aggregate and manipulate the data sourced so that it could be accurately and honestly perceived.

This included removing questionable data as well as creating new data using the input given. Some of this data includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Finding passing/failing students </li>
  <li>Percentage of students who passed math</li>
  <li>Percentage of students who passed reading</li>
  <li>Percentage of students who passed math and reading</li>
  <li>Highest and Lowest performing schools</li>
  <li>Scores by School Type</li>
  <li>Scores by Budget</li>
  <li>Scores by School Size</li>
</ul>
  
## Results
### District Summary
After editing all the data we see through the district that all Average Scores dropped slightly.
### School Summary
From the school summary data, we can see the reason the overall averages decreased in the district is because of Thomas High School specifically. After removing the entired of their 9th grades scores, their averages in Passing Reading, Passing Math and Overall Passing dropped significantly. This dropped them from the 2nd highest Overall Passing Percentage to the 8th overall.
## Summary
After looking at the data we can come to the following conclusions.

Firstly, the most impacted school was Thomas High School. They saw the largest changes in their scores/data in all categories.

Secondly, despite making a noticeable difference to their individual school, the overall data when combined with all other schools was very small. With the exception of the changes in school rankings.
